## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Steps Performed

We've put this dataset through a rigorous cleaning process, ensuring every piece of data is in its perfect place!

* **Initial Setup** 🚀:
    * `pandas` was imported to handle all our data needs.
    * The raw dataset was loaded from `hotel_bookings.csv`.
    * Display options were tweaked for maximum visibility – no squinting required!

* **Column Renaming** 🏷️:
    * Columns were given clear, intuitive names (e.g., `'adults'` became `'num_adults'`) for easy understanding.

* **Missing Value Handling** 🩹:
    * Missing `agent` values were cleverly filled with `-1`.
    * Unknown `country` values were replaced with `'Unknown'`.
    * Rows with missing `children` data were gracefully dropped.
    * The `company` column, riddled with too many missing values, was completely removed.

* **Data Type Conversion** 🔄:
    * Boolean columns were converted to their proper `boolean` type.
    * Numeric columns were converted to appropriate `integer` types, ensuring calculations are spot-on.

* **Feature Engineering** 💡:
    * `lead_time` was ingeniously binned into categories, opening doors for richer analysis.

* **Data Validation** ✅:
    * Duplicate rows were diligently identified and removed.
    * Unique values in categorical columns were verified to ensure consistency.

* **Data Export** 💾:
    * The beautifully cleaned dataset was saved as `hotel_bookings_cleaned.csv` for future use!
